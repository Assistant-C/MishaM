                <p class="animate-text">My name is Mikhail, and I want to share the story that led me to my passion for programming and shaped my</p>
                <p class="animate-text">desire to continue to develop in this field. It all started when I was a child and my father brought home an</p>
                <p class="animate-text">old computer. I was fascinated by this machine and sat behind it for hours, exploring its capabilities. I</p>
                <p class="animate-text">soon discovered the world of programming, which immediately captured my imagination. My first program written</p>
                <p class="animate-text">in Python was a simple game, but it was the beginning of my exciting journey. Every year my interest in</p>
                <p class="animate-text">programming only grew stronger. In high school, I started learning various programming languages such as Java Script</p>
                <p class="animate-text">and C++, as well as the basics of web development. One of my most memorable projects during this time was</p>
                <p class="animate-text">creating a website for a school club, which brought me and my friends a lot of joy and pride. At university I</p>
                <p class="animate-text">chose the specialty "Computer Game Developer" to deepen my knowledge and skills. Here I was introduced to the</p>
                <p class="animate-text">world of algorithms, data structures and complex systems, which gave me a strong base for further growth.</p>
                <p class="animate-text">Participating in hackathons and game jams not only allowed me to put my knowledge into practice, but also</p>
                <p class="animate-text">gave me the opportunity to work in a team, solve real problems and share experiences with other enthusiasts.</p>
